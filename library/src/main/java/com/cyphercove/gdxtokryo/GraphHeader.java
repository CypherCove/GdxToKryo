/**
 * An instance of GraphHeader should be used to wrap a data graph if backward compatibility is desired. Backward
 * compatibility is the ability for data written in a previous version of an application to be read by a newer version
 * of the application even if the fields, constructors, and methods of classes in the graph have changed.
 * <p>
 * In the case of the GdxToKryo serializers, the information in the header is used to determine which version of LibGDX
 * was used when the data was written, so it can be correctly deserialized in applications with later versions of LibGDX.
 * <p>
 * When GraphHeader is used, changes to LibGDX classes are handled automatically, so they are backward compatible. For
 * other classes, {@link TaggedFieldSerializer} or {@link VersionFieldSerializer} may be used to manage a class's backward
 * compatibility. But for custom serializers, the value of {@link #currentReadWriteVersion} can be used to keep track of changes
 * affecting compatibility between releases of an application. Custom serializers' <code>read</code> methods may call
 * {@link #getWrittenVersion(Kryo)} to retrieve the value of {@link #currentReadWriteVersion} that was used when the
 * graph was written.
 * <p>
 * The serializers in GdxToKryo are not necessarily forward compatible with all future versions of LibGDX. This is also
 * likely the case for other classes whose serializers do not use chunked encoding, such as {@link CompatibleFieldSerializer}.
 * When it is known that something in the object graph has changed such that it can no longer be read in a previous release
 * version of the application, not only should the {@link #currentReadWriteVersion} should be incremented, but also
 * {@link #minimumReadVersion} should be updated to match it. This will cause the GraphHeader serializer to skip reading
 * of the {@link #data}, leaving it null. After reading, an application can check if {@link #data} is null, and if so,
 * use the values of {@link #minimumReadVersion} and {@link #minimumReadVersionString} to react accordingly, such as
 * showing the user a prompt message to update the application. Since the data is not read, subsequent data in the
 * input stream cannot be read either.
 * <p>
 * Subclasses of GraphHeader may use {@link #writeExtra(Kryo, Output)} and {@link #readExtra(Kryo, Input)} to handle writing
 * and reading of extra information in the subclass. These are called immediately before writing or reading the {@link #data}.
 *
 * @param <T> The type of the data to be written, referenced in {@link #data}.
